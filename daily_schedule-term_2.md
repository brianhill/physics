### Week 1 &mdash; Momentum and Momentum Conservation

* Preparation for Tuesday, Aug. 29 &mdash; Chapter 1 of *Matter &amp; Interactions* to p. 12 (approximately) &mdash; Front matter and Section C1 of *Six Ideas* to p. 10 (approximately) &mdash; Choose a problem to present from each text
* Preparation for Friday, Sept. 1 &mdash; [For Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2023-09-01.pdf) &mdash; Brian's Lightning [Calculus Refresher](./resources/CalculusRefresher.pdf)

### Week 2 &mdash; Coordinates and Reference Frames

* Preparation for Tuesday, Sept. 5 &mdash; [For Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2023-09-05.pdf)
* Tuesday, Sept. 5 &mdash; Physicists&rsquo; extension of PEMDAS &mdash; Description of the [Cavendish Experiment](./resources/CavendishExperiment.png) for measuring *G* &mdash; Relativistic momentum and the (1+&epsilon;)<sup>n</sup> approximation
* Preparation for Friday, Sept. 8 &mdash; [For Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2023-09-08.pdf)
* Friday, Sept. 8 &mdash; Proof that the CoM moves uniformly for an isolated system (Moore Section C4.3, p. 57-58) &mdash; What is the redefinition of velocity (not quite the way I would put it) that Moore referred to twice for relativistic momentum (but did not go into any detail)? &mdash; In the relativistic definition of momentum, you replace *&Delta;t* with *&Delta;&tau;* so *p<sub>x</sub>=* lim<sub>*&Delta;*&tau;*&rarr;0*</sub> *m&Delta;x/&Delta;&tau;* and similarly for *p<sub>y</sub>* and *p<sub>z</sub>* &mdash; *&Delta;&tau;* is the time elapsed according to the particle, not the observer, and it is smaller by the factor we called &gamma;, e.g., *&Delta;&tau;=&Delta;t/&gamma;*, and so the relativistic momentum is greater by a factor of &gamma; &mdash; It is the sum of the relativistic momenta that is conserved in an isolated system &mdash; The approximation *&theta;=*sin*&theta;=*tan*&theta;* is very useful &mdash; It is valid only when working in radians (convert to degrees later!), and it is only a good approximation for small *&theta;*

### Week 3

* Preparation for Tuesday, Sept. 12 &mdash; [For Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2023-09-12.pdf)

Is his momentum changing? Is the momentum of his guitar &mdash; which is floating in front of him &mdash; changing? Is the momentum of the ISS changing?
