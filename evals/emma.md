### Emma

#### Donrag

Thoughtful about both the content and the form of the class.

Leaderly without being pushy.

Super-consistent on attendance, homework, and preparation.  A top scorer on the homework.

Didn't score as high as I would have guessed on the exam. I would have to see the exam to remember why that was. Sometimes people got bogged down on one problem and didn't distribute their attention to all five problems.

Has a very strong conceptual sense of the material and a very strong practical sense.

We do a lot of in-class problem presentations, and she presents well to the class.

Insightful about ways the class could be better.

Enthusiastic about the material.

All in all a very good model for a second-year.
