### Trey

#### Donrag

This physics course is a good match for Trey. He is doing well at it. He scores well on the problem sets and on the midterm where he got 82% which after curving it up for a fairly hard exam will be in the A- range.

He is ready and willing to present problems. His attendance is perfect. He is always following the discussion.

I wish students would be a little more forceful with each other on not just getting the right answers, but getting them tidily and precisely.

Trey could be one of the people that interrupts more when work at the board is going even a little astray so that I don't have to be the one that intervenes as much.

I see him frowning or looking at me to intervene when a presentation is starting to go astray.

If he keeps developing that thirst for tidiness and precision it will serve him well.


Kathleen: good stewardship
Bree: leader but doesn't dominate
