### Will

#### Donrag

There aren't going to be any surprises here for Will because he and I have had some good conversations about how the class is going for him just in the last week or so.

He got roughed up on the midterm. Substantially this was due to getting bogged down in algebra on the second exam problem that was taking him nowhere, but getting very time-consuming. Because of getting bogged down on that he didn't have enough time to properly tackle the remaining three exam problems. Some of that is just exam-taking time management. Some of it is needing to step back and see the forest for the trees a little more.

I was concerned about him getting demoralized. Freshman college-level mechanics is notoriouisly hard. It is often taught without calculus as a result. We are doing it with calculus and it is normal for it to be hard. I don't want him to feel demoralized or humbled!

I really value his voice in class. He is often willing to boldly tackle a problem or offer an opinion even when he in fact has a misconception. This is valuable for everybody in the class!

So that he does better in Term 3, I am going to be sure to make myself more available to him. He is one of the students that is too considerate to just come knocking on my door. To address that I am just encouraging him to knock on the door more as a few students are doing. I also going to set up some standard times for people to know that I am there and ready for questions.

On his problem sets I have made quite a few notations, on things that could be corrected or improved. I hope he is studying those comments. A good thing to do would be to re-do work that has imprecision. Often times I do a problem a few different times and improve upon the precision and directness of my solution each time. Students should do that as well.
