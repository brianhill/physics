#### Donrag

* Starts on and turns in HW way ahead
* Is consistently thoroughly prepared
* Is a top scorer in both problem sets and exams in both classes
* Is proactive and consistent about finding time and making appointments (and keeping them) to ask questions for both classes
* Would like her to know things her own way and also try to identify key points in arguments that are either pivotal or difficult (or both)
