### Rebecca

#### Donrag

Rebecca is prepared, enthusiastic, and cheerful and a pleasure to have in class.

She is totally consistent on attendance and homework.

She is enthusiastic about where the course is headed.

Her homework scores are very good. She doesn't utilize me much for questions. I need to reiterate to everyone that they are welcome to do that.

Her midterm was solid (17/20) which sounds like it is only 85% (and therefore in the B range) but is actually a very good score for a physics midterm (in the A range)

I have put some suggestions on her work about using more diagrams, being more precise with vectors, etc. I think I don't have more feedback to give in this donrag because I would just say to look at that commentary, which she is already doing and responding to. Physics is very pictorial, meaning that most good physicists have "cartoons" in their head about what is happening in any particular physical situation. Diagrams are an important way of developing the mental cartoons.

More sharpness and precision came up in Ryan's and Anton's commentary.
