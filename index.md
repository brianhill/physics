# Modern Introductory Physics

Fall 2023, Deep Springs College, Prof. [Brian Hill](../index.html)

## Syllabus

* [Syllabus -- FORTHCOMING](./PhysicsSyllabus.pdf) (a PDF with the same information as is on these web pages)

## Overview

Our essential goal in one semester will be to understand gravitational and electrostatic interactions. In other words, to understand the physics known in the late 1700s, but by modern methods. The course
presumes previous exposure to calculus, but will contain reminders for all the definitions and theorems used.

## Unit Outline

To be transferrable and a meaningful preparation for what is usually the 2nd semester of college-level introductory physics, we cannot completely depart from what is standard elsewhere, although we don’t have to mimic any particular method of covering that material. It is important to note that the Deep Springs course format (wherein we only meet two days per week for one-and-a-half hours and budget quite a bit of time for discussion and wrong turns), cannot cover all the material that a class meeting four times a week for one hour can. Therefore, of the standard list of essential topics, a few have necessarily been struck out of the list below. Conversely, the two italicized topics are not usually reached until the first week of the second semester of introductory physics elsewhere:

* Vectors, Position in Cartesian Coordinates, Velocity
* Acceleration, Force, Newton’s 2nd Law
* Free Fall, Inclined Planes
* ~~Friction~~ (struck so that things later in the course are less likely to struck)
* ~~Static Equilibria~~ (struck so that things later in the course are less likely to struck)
* Momentum
* Continuous Mass Distributions, Density
* Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
* ~~Position in Polar Coordinates~~ (will be struck if there isn't sufficient time)
* ~~Rotary Motion, Angular Momentum~~ (will be struck if there isn't sufficient time)
* Oscillatory Motion
* Work-Energy Theorem (Conservation of Energy)
* ~~Circular Orbits~~ (will be struck if there isn't sufficient time)
* *Electrical Charge*
* *Coulomb’s Law of Electrical Attraction and Repulsion*

## Text

There is an endless supply of textbooks with roots going so far back (e.g., to [Sears, Mechanics, Heat and Sound*](https://archive.org/details/mechanicsheatsou0000unse)) that it is hard
to think of even their most recent incarnations as modern. In fact, a completely separate course called &ldquo;Modern Physics&rdquo; is usually taught to physics sophomores to complement the traditional treatments. These textbooks are time-tested and internationally-recognized as well as ubiquitous.

To be the &ldquo;Modern Introductory Physics&rdquo; course advertised, we will use one of the relatively new and ambitious textbooks. Three we should consider are:

* [*Matter & Interactions,* 4th Edition](https://matterandinteractions.org)
* [*Six Ideas that Shaped Physics*, 4th Edition, Volumes C and N only](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/)
* [*Introduction to Classical Mechanics* by David Morin](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/classical-mechanics)
