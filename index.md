# Modern Introductory Physics

Fall 2023, Deep Springs College, Prof. [Brian Hill](../index.html)

## Syllabus

## Overview

Our essential goal in one semester would be to understand gravitational and electrostatic interactions. In other words, to understand the physics known in the late 1700s, but by modern methods. This course is intended in part to prepare students for a possible spring term course in quantum mechanics. The course would presume previous exposure to calculus, but contain reminders for all the definitions and theorems.

## Unit Outline

To be transferrable and a meaningful preparation for what is usually the 2nd semester of college-level introductory physics, we have to follow fairly closely what is standard elsewhere, although we don’t have to mimic any particular method of covering that material. It is important to note that the Deep Springs course format (wherein we only meet two days per week for one-and-a-half hours and budget quite a bit of time for discussion and wrong turns), cannot cover all the material that a class meeting four times a week for one hour can (and that is what is normally done elsewhere). Therefore, of the standard list of essential topics, a few have necessarily been struck out of the list below. Conversely, the two italicized topics are not usually reached until the first week of the second semester of introductory physics elsewhere:

* Vectors, Position in Cartesian Coordinates, Velocity
* Acceleration, Force, Newton’s 2nd Law
* Free Fall, Inclined Planes
* ~~Friction~~ (struck so that things later in the course are less likely to struck)
* ~~Static Equilibria~~ (struck so that things later in the course are less likely to struck)
* Momentum
* Continuous Mass Distributions, Density
* Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
* ~~Position in Polar Coordinates~~ (will be struck if there isn't sufficient time)
* ~~Rotary Motion, Angular Momentum~~ (will be struck if there isn't sufficient time)
* Oscillatory Motion
* Work-Energy Theorem (Conservation of Energy)
* ~~Circular Orbits~~ (will be struck if there isn't sufficient time)
* *Electrical Charge*
* *Coulomb’s Law of Electrical Attraction and Repulsion*

## Daily Schedules

Detailed daily schedules will be kept retrospectively:

## Text

There is an absolutely endless supply of texts that I do not consider modern. They are
wonderful, time-tested, internationally-recognized, and ubiquitous.

Instead we will use one of the relatively new and ambitious expositions. Three we should consider are:

* [Matter & Interactions, 4th Edition](https://matterandinteractions.org)
* [*Six Ideas that Shaped Physics*, 4th Edition, Volumes C and N only](http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/)
* [Introduction to Classical Mechanics](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/classical-mechanics)
